class Calculation:
    """
    This class is used to represent the arithmetic calculations which involves two decimal numbers and a operation.
    
    ***Encapsulation***:
    The 'Calculation' class does the encapsulation of the data i.e., a and b operands and the operation passed as a Callable function and the methods that operates on the data.
    This design will restrict the direct access of internal attribute by making controlled interactions using the methods. Using this method users can perform calculations without 
    the need to understand the internal logic of how the calcualtions are happening, So we can ensure data integrity and reduce complexity in class usage.

        '''
        Constructor for all the necessary attributes for Calculator object.
        The data that is being encapsulated:
        - 'a' is the first operand.
        - 'b' is the second operand
        - 'operation' is the operation that need to be performed on the operands.

        This method returns the result of method call to the operation that need to perform by encapsulating the operation execution, providing a clean interface to the users by

            Parameters
            ----------
